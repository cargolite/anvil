# Carglite Anvil

Anvil is an opinionated PHP code style fixer for minimalists, forked from Laravel Pint, which itself is built on top of **[PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)** and makes it simple to ensure that your code style stays **clean** and **consistent**.

> *anvil (non)* â€” a heavy iron block with a flat top and concave sides, on which metal can be hammered and shaped.

## Documentation

The only difference between Pint and Anvil is the ability to specify which indentation styles and line-endings you prefer. By default, indentation is two spaces, so a configuration file does not need to be created unless you want to change that.

Documentation for Pint can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/pint).

### Installation

You can install the package using `composer require cargolite/anvil --dev`

## License

Like Pint, Anvil is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
