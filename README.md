# Anvil

Anvil is an opinionated PHP code style fixer for minimalists, forked from [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/master/pint), which itself is built on top of **[PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)** and makes it simple to ensure that your code style stays **clean** and **consistent**.

> ***anvil** (noun)*
>
> â€” a heavy iron block with a flat top and concave sides, on which metal can be hammered and shaped.

## Documentation

The primary difference between Pint and Anvil is the ability to specify which indentation styles and line-endings you prefer. By default, indentation is four spaces, so a configuration file needs to be created to use the recommended Cargolite guideline of two spaces.

> The recommended anvil.json file is at the end of this readme.

### Installation

You can install the package using `composer require cargolite/anvil --dev`

At the time of writing, Cargolite does not use Packagist or such-like service for first-party packages. Ideally, GitHub should provide a mechanism for this, failing which we will host our own at some point. But for now, you will need to add the below to the `repositories` section of your `composer.json` file in order for the `require` command to work:

```json
{
  "type": "github",
  "url": "https://github.com/cargolite/anvil"
}
```

### Usage

To format your entire codebase:

```shell
$ vendor/bin/anvil
```

To format specific files or directories:

```shell
$ vendor/bin/anvil cargolite/Models # directory
$ vendor/bin/anvil cargolite/Models/Shipment.php # specific file
```

Anvil will display a thorough list of all of the files that it updates. You can view even more detail about Anvil's changes by providing the `-v` option:

```shell
$ vendor/bin/anvil -v
```

If you would like Anvil to simply inspect your code for style errors without actually changing the files, you may use the --test option. Anvil will return a non-zero exit code if any code style errors are found:

```shell
$ vendor/bin/anvil --test
```

If you would like Anvil to only modify the files that have uncommitted changes according to Git, you may use the --dirty option:

```shell
$ vendor/bin/anvil --dirty
```

> NOTE: Cargolite's repositories are mostly Docker based. Running the command inside a container will not work, as there is no git there.

If you would like Anvil to fix any files with code style errors but also exit with a non-zero exit code if any errors were fixed, you may use the --repair option:

```shell
$ vendor/bin/anvil --repair
```

It's recommended to have Anvil format your files on save. If your IDE supports this, either by way of baked-in functionality or otherwise a plugin, please direct it to the `anvil` binary.

For example, Visual Studio Code does not have the ability to run arbitrary commands on save, and so a package named [Run on Save](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave) helps with this. Once installed, you can update your workspace configuration file with the following:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "emeraldwalk.runonsave": {
      "commands": [
        {
          "match": ".php",
          "cmd": "vendor/bin/anvil ${relativeFile}"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

There is also a similar package [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pucelle.run-on-save).

You may also want to use a Docker-based implementation that watches for file changes and applies formatting automatically. Provided `inotify-tools` is installed, you can run the following command as a separate container:

```shell
/bin/sh -c 'file=""; inotifywait -m -r -e close_write -e create --format "%w%f" --include "\.php$" ./ | while read -r file; do if [ -n "$$file" ]; then vendor/bin/anvil "$$file"; fi; done'
```
